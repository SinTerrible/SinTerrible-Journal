<p><h2 style="font family: georgia">Hi, I'm SinTerrible and I go to school. On the weekends I like to post on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-TpCxBND704ijDn8FXbtBQ">my yt</a>
and make websites like this. On weekdays I go to school. School is very fun... especially during Robotics. Anyway, during summer break I like to make websites and read books. 
Thanks for checking out this website. Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">this link</a> for more info about me. Thanks!</h2></p>
